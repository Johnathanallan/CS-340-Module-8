#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable and readable by providing comments. I used reusable functions and keeping logic separated into different files or modules when possible. The advantages in project one is I created a dedicated CRUD Python module to handle database operations for the MongoDB collection.  I could plug in the same CRUD module without rewriting all the database logic. In the future, I could use this module as a foundation for mobile apps, REST APIs, or command-line tools that connect to the same database.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

You approach a problem as a computer scientist by first understanding what the client wants. Ask qestions and firgure out the why. My approach in that project was different than the other ones because this project felt more real-world, and I had to think more about user experience and data security. The strategies I would use is that I would use version control more actively, write clearer documentation, and plan modular architecture from the beginning to make scaling easier.

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

They solve problems using logic and algorithms, and software, but more importantly they build tools that help people and organizations function more efficiently. The work for that company helps them make quicker decisions and locate animals suited for specific rescues, and manage data more reliably.
